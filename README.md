# Public’s Sentiment Analysis on Twitter to Texas’ Six-week Ban and Overturning of Roe v. Wade

## Abstract
The objective of this project is to explore the impact of the Texas Six-week Ban and the Overturn of Roe v. Wade on social media discussions. By analyzing tweet volume and trend, the study found that both events generated significant online discourse. During the Overturn of Roe v. Wade period, the number of tweets was considerably higher than during the Six-week Ban, and the relevant hashtags used were more prevalent. The most frequently used keywords were "abortion" and "birth control" during both periods, with the sentiment analysis revealing predominantly negative views towards these topics during the latter period. Notably, there was a shift in public preferences, as the ratio of "pro-choice" tweets exceeded that of "pro-life" tweets. Further, the sentiment scores for these keywords indicated that most people endorsed "pro-choice" and expressed pessimism about women's rights and birth control as the event evolved. These findings highlight the importance of using social media as a tool for social policy analysis, as it provides insight into the public's attitudes towards significant policy changes. These findings also have potential implications for health policy going forward, as they demonstrate the need for policymakers to consider the public's views on sensitive topics like women's rights and birth control.
